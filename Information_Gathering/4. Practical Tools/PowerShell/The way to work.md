## What is PowerShell?

- PowerShell is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft for use in Windows operating systems. It provides a powerful set of tools for managing and automating tasks on Windows computers, including administrative tasks, system configuration, and maintenance tasks. PowerShell is designed to be easy to learn and use, with a simple syntax that allows commands to be entered and executed quickly and easily. It also supports the use of scripts, which can be used to automate complex tasks and processes. PowerShell is widely used by system administrators, IT professionals, and developers who work with Windows-based systems.

## The way to work

- PowerShell is built on top of the Microsoft .NET Framework, allowing you to use .NET classes and libraries to perform tasks. PowerShell provides a command-line shell for entering and executing commands, and also supports scripting for automating large and complex tasks.
- PowerShell can work with remote systems through protocols such as Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or Secure Shell (SSH). It can also integrate with other Microsoft management tools such as Active Directory and System Center Configuration Manager.
- PowerShell commands typically include objects, properties, and methods. This allows users to perform complex tasks with just a few simple commands.
- PowerShell can also be used to write scripts and modules, allowing code reuse and automation tasks to save time and effort in system administration.
